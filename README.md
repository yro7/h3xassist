## Quick Start

### Deployment Options

You can deploy H3xAssist in two ways:

1. **Docker (Recommended)** - Containerized deployment with all dependencies included
2. **Manual Installation** - Direct installation on your system

---

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

- Linux with PipeWire or PulseAudio (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 34+, Debian 12+)
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 10GB storage for application + models

#### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/h3xassist.git
   cd h3xassist
   ```

2. **Setup audio virtual device** (run once on host)
   
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-audio.sh
   ```

3. **Deploy with Docker Compose**
   
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Authenticate Teams bot account**
   
   ```bash
   ./scripts/teams-auth.sh
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**
   
   Open http://localhost:11411 in your browser

#### Docker Management

```bash
# Start/Stop service
./scripts/manage.sh start
./scripts/manage.sh stop

# View logs
./scripts/manage.sh logs

# Check health
./scripts/manage.sh health

# Backup data
./scripts/manage.sh backup

# Validate browser profile
./scripts/manage.sh validate-profile

# Audio diagnostics
./scripts/manage.sh audio-check
```

#### How Docker Audio Works

1. Host creates virtual audio sink: `h3xassist-monitor`
2. Browser in container outputs audio to this sink
3. Container captures audio from the sink's monitor source
4. Audio flows: Browser → Host Virtual Sink → Container AudioRecorder

**Note**: The virtual device is lost on host reboot. Re-run `./scripts/setup-audio.sh` after reboot, or add it to your startup scripts.

   uv run h3xassist setup models
   ```

6. **Build and start the service**
   
   ```bash
   cd h3xassist-web && pnpm build && cd ..
   uv run h3xassist service run
   ```

7. **Configure and use**

## Usage

### Manual Recording

1. Open the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:11411
2. Click "New Recording" 
3. Enter meeting details and URL
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. The system will join, record, and process automatically

### Automatic Scheduling

2. The system will automatically sync your calendar
3. Recordings are scheduled 2 minutes before meeting start
4. Processing happens automatically after the meeting ends

### Configuration

Configuration is managed through two methods:

**1. Interactive CLI Configuration**
```bash
uv run h3xassist config
```
Guided setup wizard for API keys, model settings, and integrations.

**2. Web Interface Settings**

Access settings through the web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:11411/settings

**Configuration File Location**

Settings are stored in YAML format at `~/.config/h3xassist/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
general:
  meeting_display_name: "Meeting Bot"

http:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 11411

models:
  whisperx_model_name: "large-v3"
  hf_token: "your_huggingface_token"

summarization:
  provider_token: "your_google_api_key"

integrations:
  outlook:
    tenant_id: "your_tenant_id"
    client_id: "your_client_id"
```

**Note**: Host and port are configurable through settings. The default values are shown above.

## Development

### Using Task (Recommended)

```bash
# Development workflow
task dev            # Start both backend and frontend
task dev:backend    # Start backend only
task dev:frontend   # Start frontend only

# Code quality
task format         # Format all code
task lint           # Lint all code  
task typecheck      # Type checking
task check          # Run all checks
task fix            # Auto-fix linting issues

# Production
task build          # Build frontend
task prod           # Build and start production

# Utilities
task types          # Generate TypeScript types
task clean          # Clean build artifacts
task help           # Show help
```

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Start development server
uv run h3xassist service run

# Run linting
uv run ruff check src/
uv run mypy

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/

# Start frontend development
cd h3xassist-web && pnpm dev

### Testing

Currently, testing is done manually via the web interface. The project focuses on functionality over extensive test coverage for this pet project scope.

### Troubleshooting

#### CUDA/cuDNN Library Issues

If you encounter errors related to missing CUDA/cuDNN libraries (e.g., `libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`), you can install the required libraries system-wide using the provided script:

```bash
# Install cuDNN 8.x libraries system-wide
./scripts/install_cudnn8_system.sh
```

This script will:
- Download the appropriate cuDNN wheel package
- Extract and install the libraries to `/var/opt/cudnn8/lib`
- Configure system library paths via ldconfig
- Verify the installation

**Note**: This script requires `sudo` privileges and is designed for Linux systems with CUDA support.
